SELECTION SORT
INSERTION SORT
MERGE SORT
QUICK SORT

RANDOM
Alpha and beta seems like it can handle arrays with very large Ns, indicates better runtime
Gamma and beta delta with large N random, Gamma and delta may be Insertion and selection sort

INORDER, Gamma performs well, but delta performs terribly, not finishing.


alpha and beta are merge and quick???
quicksort(worst case)= o(n^2)
mergesort(worst case)= o(nlog(n))


Alpha
Does well with large lists, HOWEVER, it does worse on random than any other

Beta
Does very well for almostOrder and Random, does VERY BAD comparatively for reverse order and inorder.
Because quicksort's worstcase is inorder and reverseorder or repeats, beta might be quicksort.


Delta
DELTA MAKES THE SAME NUMBER OF COMPARISONS NO MATTER WHAT THE LIST PROPERTY
INORDER DELTA SEEMS TO BE n^2 (best case) https://i.imgur.com/dmp9pWn.png

‚ùå NOT QUICKSORT
Delta ?? SELECTIONSORT???


Gamma
Scales very well, INORDER, it does the best out of all algorithms, (o(n) best case)
Gamma = Insertionsort?????


Answer for now:
Alpha = mergesort
Beta = quicksort
Gamma = insertionsort
Delta = selectionsort
